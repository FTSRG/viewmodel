<p>This work contains a modified version of the EMF metamodels for the
<a href="https://github.com/FTSRG/trainbenchmark">Train Benchmark</a>,
which is available under the terms and conditions of the
Eclipse Public License Version 1.0 (&quot;EPL&quot;).  A copy of the EPL is available

For compatibility purposes, its format was changed from Xcore to Ecore,
